boostrapApplicaiton bootstraps an instance of an angular application and renders a standalone component as the
application's root component.

In angular, routing allows us to load specific components or modules when accessing routes like:
/home or /dashboard/menu


ng generate component <component-name> creates a new component in the current directory.
