boostrapApplicaiton bootstraps an instance of an angular application and renders a standalone component as the
application's root component.

In angular, routing allows us to load specific components or modules when accessing routes like:
/home or /dashboard/menu


ng generate component <component-name> creates a new component in the current directory.


A constructor is used to inject depenedencies, such as services, before the component is initialized.
Additionally, it can be used for initialization logic like initializeing properties, but it is generally
recommended to move all initialization logic to lifecycle hooks like ngOnInit.


For every api call there is service. One service for all the api call get, delete, put and post
Now for each database collection there is each service.
